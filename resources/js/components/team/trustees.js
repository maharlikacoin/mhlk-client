In existence since 1973, its current focus is on the development of “common good corporations.” These are business corporations where the highest priority is the common good of humanity and nature. This is evidenced by operating as socially responsible companies and having a cap on the return to equity investors based on the risk level of the investment. All excess profit above this each year will be permanently set aside and managed forever for the common good by the company. He believes this is the next stage in the evolution of capitalism'
