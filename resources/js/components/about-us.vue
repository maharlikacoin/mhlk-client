                                            Foundation</a> is The Official Maharlika Movement, a driving force
                                            seeking change for the greater good. It is not meant for just a few but
                                            meant for everyone that believes in a higher cause that sees the true, the
                                            good, the beautiful in all people and all of nature. It believes in the

                                            The Foundation takes an oath to support its members through our digital
                                            currency, the Maharlika Coin (MHLK), and its programs and initiatives. The
                                            benefits are realized from the success of its programs, directly and
                                            indirectly, through products and services created by its technologies and
                                            its assets. Clean air, clean water, remediation of natural resources and
                                            minerals, and clean energy are basic human needs the Foundation is keen on
                                            providing. It unlocks and pledges assets long held for humanity and
                                            distributes its value through the adaptation of new ecosystems, new
                                            marketplaces, and new community hubs. All of this collectively creates value
                                            for the Foundation which is passed on to its members as a true “dividend for
                                            humanity” program.<br>

                                            There are no fees to join the Movement. Instead, our members take an oath as
